            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For though mens harts in theſe dayes are become very like the ſtone of Sycilia, the which the more it is beaten, the harder it waxeth, yet wee ſee many mens hearts enforced to relent by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing, not vnlike to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, which being moyſtned in the warmeblood of a Goat, may be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:2250:3"/> thoughe otherwiſe it cannot bee hurt with any fire, be it neuer ſo hoat, nor broken with any violence, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſtrong. We ſee the horſe which erſt while was outragiouſly fierce, yet by gentle handling to be meekned to the ſaddle: the dogge in like maner whoſe nature is agreeable to his name, is by gentlenes brought too doe that that is not incident too his nature: I my ſelfe haue ſeen a ſtout harted child ſhed many ſalte teares, at the louing ſpeach of him, that with many ſharpe ſtripes could not wring out one. Many thinges els might be ſayd to ſhew this matter, but theſe that are already ſet downe being ioyned with the practize of the wicked mentioned in the tenth Pſalm, may ſuffize for the proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for there it is written that hee by crouching and bowing himſelfe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that too paſſe againſt the poore, which by ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defiance he could neuer compaſſe, &amp; therfore in the ſame ſenſe ver. 9. he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a fowler, &amp;c. wherefore he muſt bee more contrary then an enemy, more churliſhe then a
<pb facs="tcp:2250:3"/> dogge, more vntamed then a wilde horſe, more hardharted then the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond whoſe minde cannot be molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towardes him, of whoſe curteous dealing and godly diſpoſition he hath had ſufficient triall. And as he cannot but without great vnthankfulneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the one, ſo can he not without greate vngodlines but highly regarde the other. With al which falts, I might iuſtly be charged, if after ſo good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had of your worſhips ſo good dealing towards me I ſhould not, if by any meanes I coulde ſhew ſome token of my minde as well thankfull for the ſame, as alſo reuerently eſteeming of thoſe bleſſinges of God wherewith it hath pleaſed his goodnes to beautifie you. Among the which this eſpecially deſerueth neuer to be forgotten, that he hath begotten in your mind a loue of his trueth, with an earneſt deſire to heare &amp; haue the ſame preached, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lefte very many (I might ſay the moſt part of like calling as yet either in vtter hatred or careles contempt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

<pb facs="tcp:2250:4"/> out as one wearie of the Lorde, and all his companie, and therfore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to ſpeake to whome he will, neyther regarding the preſence of God, from whence he departeth, nor yet making any reckoning of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, which by his example he offereth to many, whom he imbouldeneth to like careleſſe contempt of GOD his word. The hearing wherof is euer ſo much more burdenous vnto him, by how much leſſe he perceiueth to agree with his accuſtomed vanitie. And yet for all this he beareth himſelf in hand very mightily, that he is a maruellous good proteſtant: yea and he will either kill him, or die on him that ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the contrary, thinking in deede that he hath deſerued well at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of God, if now and then he giue any of his Miniſters the hearing of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though it be with great yrkſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde, hungring in the meane time after the world and the pleaſures thereof, whereunto he is tyed inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. But let him, and all ſuch knowe for a ſuretie, that by this kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:2250:5"/> they are ſo farre from deſeruing well of the Goſpell, that it ſuſtaineth reproofe by this their ſo little loue to heare it, ſo ſmall purpoſe of hearte to conſent vnto it, and no bringing forth of the fruites therof, yea let euery man know that althogh he beſtow his time in the hearing, reading, or meditating thereof, yea his goodes and life it ſelfe in the defence of the ſame, yet can he not chalenge any wel deſeruing of the trueth, but the trueth may iuſtly of him, becauſe the goodneſſe thereof (which is the worke of Gods ſpirite) hath ſo rauiſhed his minde, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is nowe deare vnto him, but it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For who can recompence the word for begetting him to God? doth wiſdome cry vnto vs, becauſe ſhe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect without vs? No, no, it is for our profit that ſhee would ſo louingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbrace vs: as for her ſelfe, though we al periſh, ſhe is neuer the worſe, if none periſh, ſhe is neuer the better. And ſhal we thinke that our comming to heare her, doth in any reſpect beautifie or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne her that is perfect without vs?
<pb facs="tcp:2250:5"/> ſome thinke ſo, I wote it well, yea I would the moſt were not perſwaded ſo: for then more ſhould be adorned by her, for ſhe lodgeth not, but with the meeke harted ones. O good Lord, who hath bewitched vs with this minde? Surely the very pride of our mind, that ſuffreth vs not to go to the hearing of Gods word, with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reuerent purpoſe of heart cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon God to be profited therby, but rather to furniſh out the ſhewe of hearers, thinking ſo to come within the preaching of the worde, and to bring it within the compaſſe of our daunger. Whervpon it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paſſe, that more thankes are giuen to ſome hearers, for being at a Sermon, by ſome, then there are vnto God for the benefit of his word taught therin: yea ſome Preachers alſo (I feare me) can be contented nowe and then to ioyne with their hearers to rob God of his glory, I meane ſuch as ſeeke for credit by their auditorie. But leauing theſe Pickthanke Hearers and Preachers, which carrye the
<pb facs="tcp:2250:6"/> prayſe from God, vnto that wil of god whervnto he hath foreordained them. I returne. Seeing therefore it pleaſed God, moreouer and beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleſſinges beſtowed vpon you, to enrich your heart with this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pearle, of loue to his word (which is a true token of the new man put on: ſo that the heat thereof now flameth out, to the benefit of many dwelling in Kings Hatfield and the places therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in thoſe parties of Eſſex, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that godly exerciſe of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which it pleaſed god by your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips meanes to bring in thither, that thereby many might bee rayſed from their death in ſinne, vnto the life which is in Chriſt Ieſus, others confirmed in the fayth, and all diſpiſers left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all excuſe vnto Iudgement: ſeeing I ſay it hath pleaſed God to make you haue ſuch a loue to his word, thereby declaring that ye are of God, and that he hath taken you not onely from the number of Gods profeſſed enemies: but alſo of godleſſe Goſpellers, whoſe name is all that they haue of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb facs="tcp:2250:6"/> I thought my part (the premiſſes conſidered) and hauing not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes when I was in thoſe partes, but ſince my departure alſo, experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced your worſhippes good dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me to offer vnto your godly protection theſe fewe dayes trauell in the alone. Engliſhinge of theſe M.

Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing moreouer that ye would allowe and accept in good part this my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſmall ſoeuer, as a token of my thankfull minde, which would not ſtay to do that that I ought if I cold do that that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not. But this I haue don, leaſt I ſhould be vnto your worſhippe as the Humble bee is vnto the fayre flower, which when ſhe hath ſucked honny out thereof, leaueth it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth: or like the Swallow, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

What profit ſhall come therof I knowe not, what I would ſhoulde come, God knoweth: onely my hope is that it ſhall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnprofitable: for who dare but go forward, when god threatneth him for ſtanding ſtill? who can ſleepe when the trumpet that foundeth out Gods Iudgement cryeth ſo loude in his eares (awake?) who can but look to the amendment of his, whether chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants, ſeeing the Lorde threatneth to viſit thoſe children and ſeruantes that are wicked, yea though they belong to the king? Who wilbe holden backe from reforming abuſes not onely in himſelf, but alſo in thoſe that be vnder him, when hee heareth the Lord ſay that he wil make a ſpeedie riddance of all ſuch as in meekeneſſe of heart haue not ſought him, and wrought his Iudgement. All which thinges with many other are at large ſet out in this Propheſie, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eſpecially againſt ſuch which while
<pb facs="tcp:2250:7"/> they might, would not for ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpecte reforme them ſelues from thoſe groſſe enormities, and blind ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions wherwith they were enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led: notwithſtanding they were ofte called therefroe by the Miniſters of God, the Prophetes whome he ſent vnto them. The Lorde graunt that we may lay theſe thinges to heart, and ſo apply them vnto our ſelues, that the fearce wrath of the Lord that hangeth ouer our heades, and is already threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall vpon vs, may bee turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: or, if it muſt needes come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no warning will ſerue vs, yet that all thoſe whome the knowledge and appearing of his grace hath called from the luſtes and vngodly vanities of the worlde vnto the working of his Iudgementes in lowlineſſe of minde may be hidden in that day. But that I breed not irkeſomnes in ſted of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profit, I ceaſe to ſpeake of theſe thinges which are more at large and very truly, though plainly laid open in theſe ſermons, ſhewing as wel the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Propheſie, as applying
<pb facs="tcp:2250:8"/> the doctrine therein contained to that vſe wherevnto it was firſt reuealed, which in no age could more fitly bee done, than in this griſly old and down ſtouping age of the worlde, which by reaſon of blinde and wilfull ignorance is made drunke with the pleaſures of ſinne, whoſe ende is death that ſtayeth not.

For all the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the Prophets is occupied about the conſideration of mans ſaluation, then about fayth and the worſhip of God, and conuerſation of life: Laſtly about the fortelling of things to come: but of all theſe thinges there is no one, wherein there appeareth not manifeſt argumentes of Gods ſpirite.

For out of hand he began to ſéeke the Lorde, and aſſoone as hée was of age and authoritie, in the 12. yeare of his reigne, he began a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as wel in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as in the land of Iſrael, where ſome remnaunt of vnknowne, and poore men aboade,
<pb facs="tcp:2250:14"/> when the <hi>Aſſirians</hi> had tranſlated into captiuitie the greater parte of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

And
<pb facs="tcp:2250:15"/> without delaye, he taking the Lordes cauſe in hand, with greater zeale called together the nobles of his kingdome, with all the people, and when hée had cauſed the bookes of the law to be read openly vnto them, hée renewed the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt with the Lord, and by publike authoritie hée appoynted a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby was rooted out of the land of <hi>Iuda</hi> and Iſrael, what abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſuperſtition ſo euer remained in the firſt reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Moreouer while theſe things were in this order accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing, ſome yéelded their hearty obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto the king, and with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere loue of godlineſſe, ſubmitted them ſelues to the reformation: but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the people, &amp; noble men did in huggermugger foſter thoſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and vngodly worſhip, wherwith they were accuſtomed in the dayes of the former kinges; leaſt they ſhoulde haue bene cut of altogether: as by this it may appeare that after the death of <hi>Ioſia,</hi> they all returned ſodenly vnto wickedneſſe, and brought in againe thoſe ſuperſtitions, which erſt while
<pb facs="tcp:2250:15"/> were abandoned. Here therefore it was, that this our Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> was ſent to be a felow companion with <hi>Ieremy</hi> in this buſineſſe, that he might call into the way thoſe louers of theyr own ſuperſtition; but with threatned deſtruction to frighten thoſe which were paſt amendment. This thing hée performeth in thrée ſermons, which are declared in like number of chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

The third thing he bendeth againſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and threatneth deſtruction vnto the ſame, that he might ſhake from them their vaine confidence of

                  <p>We haue ſpoken theſe thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hiſtorie of the tyme of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah,</hi> and the argument of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, more largly, becauſe they make not only for the opening or vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the prophecies: but alſo ſerue very much for our inſtruction.

                  <p>Furthermore we are taught, how the

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2250:20"/> by the rule of God his law, do examine the diſpoſition of their owne fleſh: but when puniſhments are generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, two things for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part do alwaies hinder, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for eyther we thinke that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belongeth not vnto vs, or els wée complaine of the miniſters roughneſſe, or ſharpeneſſe: as though they ſhould diſpightfully deale againſt vs, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; hauing deſerued no ſuch thing. It ſhall bée néedefull therefore to deale plainely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one may know, &amp; in themſelues acknowledge the cauſes of Gods wrath. The Prophet Zephany in this preſent place performeth both theſe thinges. For firſt hee bendeth theſe threatninges againſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Iuda &amp; Ieruſalem: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wickedneſſes, which muſt with ſuch plagues be purged: this place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teacheth vs to iudge of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our time, &amp; what ſins they muſt eſchew, which would that their affairs ſhould be well ſéene vnto.

But Ieruſalem, beſides that it was the

Therfore Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah telleth them, that al that their confidence was vaine, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeeing that before all others, hee threatneth Iuda and Ieruſalem. But from hence a generall doctrine may bée gathered: namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch as frowardly ſtriue againſt God, can be in ſafetie by no outward prerogatiues, or promiſes made vnto them.

But let thoſe thinke that this is ſpoken vnto them, whoſoeuer are carefull to keepe the remnaunt of <hi>Baal,</hi> whiles reformation of doctrin and religion is eſtabliſhed. This doe they which priuily doe conueie out of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Images, painted Tables, relikes of Saincts, and inſtruments of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould not be deſtroyed with the reſt: as many alſo as cauſe new Images to be made, at their own coſt, wherevnto they burne lightes at home and pray before them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, with whome alſo they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially do deſerue to be reckoned, which carefully kéepe in minde ſuperſtitious praiers, and do teach the ſame to their children; ſo ſowing the ſéedes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2250:23"/> into their tender mindes. Theſe men are the moſt noyſome plagues of the Church; for it commeth to paſſe that by them the doctrine of the word cannot haue his profit with thoſe which at home haue their teachers of errours: and the ſame doe forthwith conceiue great hatred againſt the trueth, if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time their manners bee ſomewhat more fréely rebuked by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. But there is no doubt but GOD hath his broomes wherewith hee wil purge, not without their great plague and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement, thoſe reliques of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he threatens <hi>that hee will cut of the name of Chemarim with the Prieſts:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Kemarim. 2.</note> hee ſpeaketh of the miniſters of forbidden and vnlawful worſhippe, which were many and diuers, againſt God his ordinaunce: For he had ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified vnto him ſelfe the tribe of Leuy: out of that tribe ought to be taken the high Prieſt, vnto whome the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the word and holy rites appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: he had thoſe which together with him did miniſter about the worde, and

But they, being not contented with the one and onely true God, enterteined ſtraunge Gods, and therefore they ſtoode in neede of new ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Prieſts, to do ſeruice for thoſe ſaid falſe Gods: herevpon it came, that prieſtes were appoynted vnto <hi>Baal,</hi> of whome there is often mention made in ſacred hiſtorie, neither is it to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that other Gods alſo had their ſacrifices, which tooke vpon them theſe fore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ceremonies, which before were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer known.

                     <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2250:24"/> they were ſet on fire with a wonderfull zeale of religion, or rather ſuperſtition: as thoſe Seraphical doctors are, which of fooliſh and ſuperſtitious men, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the lightes of the worlde. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were eſpecially appoynted to burne Frankencenſe, I ſuppoſe they were rather ſo called by reaſon of that office. For this worde <hi>Kemar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Hebrewes ſignifieth to ware hotte, and alſo wax blacke, and becauſe the Prophet doeth coupple them with the Prieſtes, it is euident that they were a kind of men of inferiour degrée, ſkilfull in thoſe myſteries, or that they were as it were clearks, or ſexſtons, or ſome vnder miniſter to them which were in the higheſt rowme: as in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Maſſe Prieſts, chappell Clarke, or vnder Curat alwaies attending vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, and ſeruing the turn of the rich and fat Canons, and Paſtors; ſuch are woont to be greatly accounted of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other fatlings taking their ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure careleſly theſe do throughly go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with, &amp; do perfourme al holy rites, &amp; ceremonies belonging to the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:2250:25"/> and theſe I warrant you liue, not only by begging. And this was the cauſe that although thoſe fatter <hi>Baalites,</hi> were taken away, yet theſe fellowes togeather with their Idolles, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Prieſtes, ſeeming more holy then others, were priuily maintained of ſuch as were ſuperſtitious. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was done contrarie to the Lawe, <note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> which appoynteth that the falſe Prophet, and ſeducer, muſt bee put to death, God himſelfe draweth out the ſworde of his iudgement againſt them. But theſe things agrée meruellous fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnto theſe our times. For it is well knowne, that Chriſt vnto his Church hath appoynted teachers, which ſhould gather it together, and gouerne it with the doctrine of the Goſpel, <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 1. Cor. 12.</note> and that hee would not haue it ouerburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an idle companie of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men. For although Paule may ſéeme to haue appointed in the Church, degrées of Miniſters, ſaying that ſome were appoynted Apoſtles, ſome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ſome Euangeliſts, and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: yet all thoſe were ordained vnto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2250:25"/> this end, that the doctrine of the Goſpel might bee reteined, wherewith the Church, can onely, and alone, be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and preſerued. But after that the Goſpel being neglected, <hi>Rome</hi> beganne to bee mad for ſuperſtition, new orders of Miniſters alſo crept in, and ſeauen generall degrées were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. Firſt, dorekéepers, readers, exorciſtes, or adiurours, attendentes, ſubdeacons, deacons, prieſtes, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. But againe among theſe, ſome were chappel clarkes, or vndercurats, vpon whoſe backes, for the moſt parte, was laide the care and charge of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church matters, other were paſtors of pariſhes, or Canons, who vnder pretence of religion, gaue themſelues to eaſe and pleaſure: and of theſe, ſome were wardens, or ſuch as had the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of matters; ſome were Deans, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome were gardians, others were chaunters, the vnder prieſtes in like manner according to the number of their Gods and offices, had their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall names, and vnto theſe, the Monks,
<pb facs="tcp:2250:26"/> the Nuns, the Friers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lolhards, the Begutes, thoſe of the elder ſorte, and of the younger, the heremits &amp;c.

Other ſome (as Paule ſaith) crept into houſes, and abuſed the ſimplicitie of the ſuperſtitions, and made traines alſo to get the priuate goodes of many men. And becauſe thoſe inferior orders do cary amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the vnſkilful multitude, the perſwaſion of pouertie, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they alſo found many fauourers, if at any time the reformation of the Church were begunne. But they did eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially hurt the Church for this cauſe, that although they feigned them ſelues to giue place to the goſpel: yet amongſt their like they did priuily defend the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious worſhip, and did incenſe the minds of very many againſt the truth, and Miniſters thereof.

Hee meaneth the ſtar wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers: for they are called the hoſt of heauen, as well for their mouing, and order which they haue kept euer ſince the creation: as alſo becauſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſtitiouſly led, haue thought that the ſame haue a working power vpon the earth; and haue accuſtomed vnder them, as it were vnder Gods to ſubiect the affaires of men. This was a very olde errour, eſpecially amongſt them of the Eaſt, which firſt of al others beganne to view the mouing of the ſtars, and according to the corruption of mans wit, tooke from thence the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuperſtition, from whence they ought to haue acknowledged the power of God, being the creatour of all thinges. But it appeareth by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie
<pb facs="tcp:2250:27"/> of Ioſia, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſuperſtition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed alſo, euen vnto the Iewes: for it is written that Ioſia tooke away the horſes which the kings of Iuda had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſeruice of the Sunne, &amp; that he alſo burned the chariots of the Sun. And there is alſo mention made of the altars which <hi>Achaz</hi> had builded vpon the roufe of his ſupping chamber. For they imagined that this worſhip ſhould be ſo much the more liked of and allowed, if it were done in an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place, and as it were in the ſight of the Sun, and we knowe that in thoſe countries their houſe toppes were flat, that they might ſerue for one to walk on, and many other purpoſes. But it is very like, that after the reformation made by Ioſia, they practiſed their ſuperſtition more priuily, and onely in night time. But God teſtifieth that hée is not ignoraunt of their doinges, and threatneth that in ſhort time hée will cut them of.

Neyther ſhall wée erre as I thinke, if wée, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the place of them both. For wée knowe out of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that the Iewes at that time did intreate Leagues with foren nations. Which doubtleſſe was the cauſe, that they woulde imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their manners, and attire: and howe much thoſe that bée ſuperſtitious doe attribute vnto apparrell, it may be gathered by the Monkes and Maſſe Prieſtes, which thinke it a ſinne, that neuer can bée purged, if they ſhoulde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them neuer ſo little.

Hée doubted not ſometime among his acquaintaunce to ſpeake thoſe things, wherein he both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly reprehended the boldneſſe of the Biſhops, and alſo the fooliſhneſſe of the people, that ſo woondred at them. It came to paſſe at a certaine time, as hée walked vp and downe his chamber, his goune and coate for the great heate bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layde apart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> two of his Cardinals that came too ſpeake with him were at his chamber doore.

But he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to come in, and not to doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing: and being come in, he cauſed them to doe off theyr attire, as hee had doone. For ſéeing (ſaith he) that I being in the ſhadowe am ſo whot, how much more are your garmentes a burden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too you, that haue come ſo farre too talke with mee? doe you therfore in like manner lay aſide your gounes and coates, and neuer ſtay at the matter.
<pb facs="tcp:2250:41"/> But they prolonging the time becauſe they were baſhfull, he compelled them ſo to doe. And when afterwarde he had walked a while betwixt them, what thinke you (ſaith he) that our Citizens of Rome woulde ſay, if they ſhoulde ſee vs walke thus through the citie.

Then he ſayde vnto them, you ſee ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my brethren howe greatly wee are bound to our apparrell, that doeth ſaue vs from ſuch iniuries, and doth procure vs ſo great opinion of holineſſe: <hi>Iulius</hi> ſpake very flatly as the matter was: and I doe not doubt, but many in their minds doe ſay the ſelfſame thing which woulde bee counted religious with the formoſt, and yet laugh cloſely in theyr ſléeues when they ſée the wide open ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe of the fooliſh common people, nay of Princes themſelues, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe Hobgoblins, and ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like attyre haue them in reuerence and reputation.

                     <note place="margin">He ſheweth that it is neere at hand.</note> Secondly they referre this day of the Lorde vnto the time yet long to come, that by prolonging the time, they myght take their pleaſure.

                     <note place="margin">The argument and vſe of the ſecond ſermon.</note> IN the firſt Sermon the Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah,</hi> hath vnto thoſe Iewes that fauoured Idolatrie and ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced from God, puniſhment that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now hanged ouer their heads. The ſecond Sermon followeth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcribed in this Chapter, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an exhortation vnto repentance; and it doeth conſiſt wholy of three partes. In the firſt parte hée dealeth with thoſe Hypocrites, that outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did allow of the reformation, but in the meane ſeaſon did ſecretly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuperſtition, and ſpeaking more roughly to theſe, he vrgeth them with new threatnings, that they might be conuerted vnto the Lorde. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde part he commeth vnto the godly, which from their heart did conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of God, &amp; that reformation
<pb facs="tcp:2250:59"/> that was eſtabliſhed, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they being deceiued by the example, and familiaritie of others, dealt ouer negligently, and did from them euery day receiue ſome vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Prophet handleth theſe more gently, and exhorteth them to go about the Lordes buſineſſe with great zeale, and that they ſhoulde not ſuffer them ſelues once to be remoued from their duties. Laſt of all, for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe, hee propoundeth a conſolation, whereby hee remedieth that offence, which he perceiued would grow from the victories of their wicked enemies, and vnmeaſurable triumphings of the nations next adioyning, which tooke meruellous great pleaſure in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Gods people. For hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that the Iudgement of God ſhall alſo come vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that as ſoone as he hath &amp; vſed their labor &amp; miniſtery in puniſhing of his own, then they in like manner ſhalbe puniſhed for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He teacheth the hypocrits what they ſhould do.</note> In the firſt parte hee ſpeaketh vnto the Hypocrites in theſe words, <hi>Search and gather your ſelues together, yea
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2250:59"/> ſearch I ſaye, and gather your ſelues together, ye nation, not worthy to be beloued.</hi> Hee calleth them a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not worthye to bee loued, which may be vnderſtood as wel actiuely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, in reſpecte of their doing; or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, in reſpect of their ſuffering. Actiuely, in this manner, that hee may ſhewe that in them there was no loue or deſire of celeſtiall or heauenly thinges, neyther that they did deſire the kingdome of God, wherevnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ought to ſtriue and contende: paſſiuely thus, that they were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any loue or mercy, and that they could not any longer bee approued of God: both theſe expoſitions doe very well agrée vnto Hypocrites. For as for thoſe thinges that belonge to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they may eaſily neglect them, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they ſéeke for any thing in their religion, ſauing their owne praiſe, namely that they may be ſéene of men. And ſurely God cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte nor away with thoſe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the profeſſion of fayth, with a lye, and diſſimulation, the which
<pb facs="tcp:2250:60"/> that moſt excellent diuine power doth greatly abhorre. But what is it, that he doeth commaunde them? <hi>Searche</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and gather your ſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> In the Hebrewe there is but one word, which the interpreters doe expounde two wayes. For ſome doe deriue it out of that Hebrew Radical, that ſignifieth ſtubble. And they affirm that here is noted a very diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie or ſearch, ſuch as men are wont to vſe in gathering together ſtubble, or other very ſmal things. Others affirm that it is deriued ſimply, and properly, of the Hebrew Radical, that ſignifieth to gather and congregate together: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter is doubtfull, and yet both ſenſes agrée very well with the purpoſe of the Prophet. I thinke that I ſhall not doe amiſſe, if I ſhall lay open both the ſenſes, by tranſlating that with two words, which in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe is ſpoken in one. For (hauing regarde to the firſt) hée admoniſheth the Hypocrites that they content not them ſelues with a vaine ſhadowe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2250:60"/> and outwarde ceremonies of benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuperſtitions: but for that they ſhould deſcende more deeply into them ſelues, and by the rule of Gods worde examine whatſoeuer was in them, that ſo they might knowe theyr er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and amende them being known: but hauing reſpecte to the other ſenſe, hee exhorteth that they which nowe were deuided into many ſuperſtitions and ſectes, woulde agree in one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of fayth and true religion: and that in the vnitie thereof, they ſhoulde bee gathered vnto one GOD, For hee had accuſed them before, that they worſhipped GOD and the hoſt of heauen, and that they did ſweare by GOD and <hi>Malchom,</hi> and wee knowe that this is proper to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, that as ſoone as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the true GOD, euery one doeth inuent vnto him ſelfe newe Gods; and ſo are rent in ſunder into very contrary ſectes.

It is required of theſe (that the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of fleſhe and the world being put of and reiected) they ſhould examine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they haue, according to the rule of Gods worde. For ſéeing they did content themſelues ſo well with their owne fancies, they will neuer ſuffer themſelues to bée brought againe into the way, excepte ſome ſharper correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bée miniſtred.

Moreouer when they come to deliberate vpon theſe matters, it is no leſſe needefull for them, their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſuperſtitions and perſwaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vtterly abandoned, to be gathered together vnto God, and to the vnitie of his Church. This ſhal come to paſſe if they acknowledge God onely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: ſubmitting themſelues to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his woord, and ſhall giue too Chriſt alone, the name and glorie of a Mediatour, and vnder him being head, growe together, with all his choſen into one bodie of his Church.

<pb facs="tcp:2250:63"/> which is taught in the woord of God, and figured in the Sacraments, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baptiſme and the Lordes Supper: the vſe whereof among other thinges is to gather the Church together after a viſible manner, and to preſerue the vnitie of the members thereof. Beſids this, as Ieſus Chriſt the only ſonne of God, is vnto vs the author of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo he doth not beſtow ſaluation any where, but vpon his Church which is his bodie, and therefore they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaluation whoſoeuer they be, that are without the fellowſhippe of his Church. For they wander about vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſuperſtitions, neyther can they euer be remedied, except they be gathered vnto God in Chriſt, as our Prophet doth admoniſh.</p>

                     <note place="margin">He preſcribeth the Godly their dueties.</note> But becauſe our nature is ſlow in theſe thinges he addeth a reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſheweth that it is needefull to put that ſpeedilie in execution, which he commaundeth, <hi>Before</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree come foorth.</hi> So he calleth the counſell of God, or his ſentence which earſt while he hath pronounced by his

It is profitable that wee ſhould be occupied in the diligent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe thinges, that we doe not after a ſlumbering manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the threatnings of God.

But if the Prophet ſpeake ſo modeſtly of the godly: what is to be thought of the wicked, which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the admonitions and threatnings of GOD? Peter ſawe this, when hée ſayde, <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>If the righteous ſhall ſcarſe bee ſaued, where ſhall the wicked, and the ſinner appeare?</hi> For although the Citie, and the Temple being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the people was carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way vnto Babylon, yet they were hidden, and founde ſure aſſiſtance in God, as many as folowed this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell. For Ieremy had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Babylonians aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, &amp; very helpful vnto him.

                  <p>Secondly the Prophet ſheweth the greatneſſe of the daunger: that by this conſideration he myght ſtir vp the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a conſtant truſt of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and an earneſt ſtudie of godlynes: <hi>Becauſe Haza is forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Aſhkalon is made deſolate, they ſhall driue out Aſhdod at the noone day, and Ekron ſhalbe rooted vp.</hi> The meaning is, that the hurly burly of the warre, that was at hand, ſhould be ſo great, that it ſhould come euen to the néere Cities of the Philiſtins, which as yet were not ouercome, although they were ſometime puniſhed with great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <note place="margin">Paronomaſia</note> But the Prophet vſeth a very beautifull reſemblaunce of wordes, where hee ſpeaketh of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Ekron,</hi> which they that are ſkilfull of the Hebrewe tongue, may very well note, that they may eaſily ſee
<pb facs="tcp:2250:70"/> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets were neither vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the arte of Rhetorique, neyther yet without their eloquence.

But it is well knowne by them that haue written of countries to deſcribe their ſituations, that all this coaſt borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon the Sea, was in times paſt very famous by reaſon of fiue cities, whereof the Prophet hath alreadie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fower, as <hi>Amos</hi> alſo doth, which a little before threatned them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Gaza</hi> lay more towardes the South, then any of the other: this was famous by reaſon of a haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, which Conſtantinus afterwarde after his own name called Conſtantia. But Iulianus reſtored vnto it againe the olde name, perhaps becauſe of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred he bare to Conſtantinus, and for that he was delighted with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes of Gentilitie or Heathenneſſe. Next vnto this was Geth, where Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah the Giaunt was borne, and is heere omitted, eyther becauſe it was
<pb facs="tcp:2250:73"/> vtterly raſed, or elſe was of leſſe value then that it ſhoulde come in any reckoning: the third was <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelon,</hi> where <hi>Antipater</hi> the Father of <hi>Herod</hi> the Greate was afterwardes borne: in the fourth place was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zotus,</hi> which among all the cities of <hi>Syria,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, abode the longeſt ſiege, when <hi>Pſalmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was King of Egypt, whereby it may appeare, that it was very well furniſhed for the warres. <hi>Meta</hi> calleth it the mart of the marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of all <hi>Arabia,</hi> which was the cauſe that it was ſo corrupted with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot and delicatenes, that the manners of Azotus grewe into a byword. With theſe is Akron reckoned, being builded vpon the maine Land. Furthermore the Prophet tearmeth al that country by twoo names, whereby he ſheweth foorth their manners. Firſt he calleth them the nation of the Cheretims, that is to ſay, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deſtroy and plucke vpp by the rootes. By which name one of Dauid his legions was called, being alwaies next vnto, or at the kings

Wee knowe that Warriours are roughe and cruell, and it is too bee beeleeued that they gotte them that name as bloody and cruell men are woonte too doe, which ſéeke for prayſe by murdering and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of whole nations. Then hee calleth them the Canaanites, partely becauſe they came of the offſpring of thoſe that remained of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canaanites, partly, that hee might ſhew, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they were outragiouſly bent, GOD made no more account of them, then of the Canaanites, which eraſtwhile hath appointed them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction, And he doeth not without an earneſt expreſſing of his entent or meaning, tell them by the way, that the woorde of the Lord is againſt them. As though hee ſhoulde ſay, the people of GOD muſt indeede be puniſhed, and you ſhall ſee them led away into captiuitie but the iudgement of GOD will not ſtay there, but from thence it ſhall alſo come vntoo you, which muſte no leſſe be puniſhed then they. By the example wee are admoniſhed
<pb facs="tcp:2250:74"/> that the iudgmentes of God are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time deferred, but not altogether ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: theſe ſhould haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with the other Cananites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. 800. yeeres before this, when the Iſraelites entered the land promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their fathers, Ioſua bieng their cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine and guide. But they abode ſtill in their roomes, partly through the ſlouth of the Iſraelites, who being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed with the labours and daungers thereto belonging, ſought for eaſe and quietnes: partly by the determinate counſell of God, which woulde haue ſome to remaine, by whoſe vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the vertue of the Iſraelites ſhould be exerciſed, leaſt they flowing in y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenes, ſhould wax woorſe and worſe and come to nothing. But becauſe they regarded not the counſell of God, but being puffed vp with pride, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the church, ſhed innocent bloode, ſpent their life defiled with euery kind of wickednes, the Lord forſooke not his owne cauſe, but puniſhed them being paſt mendment, with that ouerthrow which lately they had deſerued. There
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2250:74"/> bee in the hiſtories many ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in the ſtudie whereof they ought diligently to be occupied, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſe them ſelues, that they ſhal neuer be puniſhed, becauſe as wel they, as their forefathers had liued long in their beaſtly &amp; corrupt manners, not taſting thereby any harme, or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie: for God hath his certaine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for the which hee winketh for a time, but he hath alſo appointed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houre vnto euery one, wherein they muſt be plagued for their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

But he reſtraineth this promiſe to them that remayne, (as other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets doe alſo) becauſe the number of the wicked was the greateſt, which muſt vtterly be deſtroyed. But theſe thinges are fulfilled two manner of waies: for firſt they that returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Babilon, had theſe countries in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in the hiſtorie of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, <note place="margin">Macha. 10.11.13.</note> it is written of Ionathan and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, that they brought Gaza and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalon with the places there about into the Iewes ſubiection.

But they did then eſpecially declare their hartes, when the Iewes were led away captiues by the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. For then they triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:2250:77"/> them, being ouercome, and went aboute to ſtretch the boundes of their kingdome euen vnto Iuda, as we ſhall heare by and. This was a great and very bitter corſey, wherewith the faith of very many was tryed, when they ſaw the choſen people of GOD to be ouercome by the wicked; and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles borne of inceſt, ſafely to enioy their poſſeſſions: and ſhould heare the reproches of the ſame wherewith they did girde at, and defame the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or did hazard or bring into daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the glory of God himſelfe. The Prophet Zephaniah therefore dealeth diligently againſt them. For firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe GOD may ſéeme vnto many to be blinde and deafe, ſéeing that ſuch thinges were committed and ſpoken by theſe, and that without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he bringeth in him ſelfe, ſaying: <hi>I haue heard the reproch of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites, and the rebukes of the children of Ammon, wherby they vpbrayded my people, and magnified them ſelues againſt their borders.</hi> In which words
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2250:77"/> hée deſcribeth their wickedneſſe, and teacheth them, that hée is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt of any of thoſe thinges. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their ſinnes, he accuſeth them of two thinges. Firſt, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched the Iewes, and ſpake many things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumeliouſly, not only againſt the Iewes, but alſo againſt GOD and his true religion, which theſe Iewes profeſſed. The other is: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they exalted themſelues: that is, they enterpriſed many thinges very proudly againſt their broders, while they would haue layde the countrey of the Iewes vnto their own land. Amos in like manner rebuketh this deſire of inlarging their kingdome, in the Amonites, which affirmeth that they abſteined not from ripping vp of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men great with childe; inſomuch that by that kinde of crueltie they conſtrained the Galaadites to yéelde them ſelues. And Ieremy ſpeaketh vnto the ſame, <note place="margin">Iere. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>Hath Iſrael no childe? haue they none to inherit? why ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Malchom poſſeſſe Gad, and
<pb facs="tcp:2250:78"/> his people dwel in his cities.</hi> Both theſe ſinnes were before all others very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, and woorthy of greeuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for triumphing ouer them that were brought lowe, they offended againſt the lawe of nature, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to bewayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> calamities of others to acknowledg that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chance of all men is befraught with miſery and wretchedneſſe. But for aſmuch as they gaue the raine to ſauſie ſpeech both againſt god &amp; his ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice it appeared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had put of altaſt of religion. Againe, forasmuch as they inuaded that land which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Abraham, and did giue it, not without many wonders, to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited of his poſteritie, this iniurie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched both vnto God himſelfe, neyther yet did they ſhewe themſelues thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as they ought vnto Abraham, who in time paſt brought their progenitour into this land, &amp; being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captiue he deliuered him from the hand of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Theſe things ought too bee marked of thoſe that are pricked with the like deſire of bearing rule. For we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2250:78"/> know that God in olde time diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to euery natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his land or country. They therfore offend againſt him who ſoeuer they be that ſtreatch out farther their boundes being by him appointed. And although God vſeth their wodnes in puniſhing thoſe that abuſed his giftes and benefites, yet the ſelfe ſame ſhall not ſcape vnpuniſhed, as we haue taught in an other place by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. But in this place it is full of moſt ſweete comfort, that he ſaith, he hath heard their reproches &amp; rebukes. For heereby they might learne, that God would neuer leaue to care for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although he ſuffred them ſome ſpace to be afflicted, but that that is ſpoken of them ought to be applyed vnto all: for God both heareth and ſeeth in euery place of the earth whatſoeuer is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt thoſe that be his. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his glory is coupled with their ſafetie, he neuer doeth neglect it. Let vs therefore be mindful of theſe things as often as we heare the reproches and ſcoffes of the wicked, neither let vs
<pb facs="tcp:2250:79"/> think that eyther the glorie of God, or our welfare is any whitte impayred thereby.</p>

This befell the Iewes when they were led away vnto Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. For the Philiſtines reioyced in their miſerie, whom Dauid afore time had brought in ſubiection: the Moabits and the Amonites being of their owne blood, leaped for ioy, and together with their enemies ſcoffed at them. And in an other place we ſaw that the Idume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did the like: &amp; before theſe things
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2250:82"/> came to paſſe, the power of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Ethiopians, was great, who ſlew the moſt godly king Ioſia, being ouercome in battaile, and caryed Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acham his ſonne into Egypt. Beſides this they ſawe the power of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians to increaſe very huge, which did openly profeſſe hatred againſt the true GOD and his true religion, and did tauntingly hit the ſame in the téeth of the miſerable captiues. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was néede of diligent inſtruction, which the Prophet in this third parte of this ſermon adioyneth. For he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that GOD beginneth with his people to puniſh, but afterwarde hee paſſeth from them vnto the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which now tooke pleaſure in the miſerie of his people.

Theſe thinges were in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, when all theſe nations together with their Gods &amp; ſuperſtitions were by the horrible iudgement of God cut of, and cleane wiped away. And then alſo when <hi>Nabucadnezar</hi> (being chaſtiſed with the rod of GOD) by his kingly edictes proclamed the true worſhip of God, through all the Eaſt parts: which thing <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> did after him. <note place="margin">Dani. 3.4.6.</note> But theſe thinges were fulfilled principally in Chriſt, which is this great ſtone in déede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rowled back without mens hands, made an end of thoſe old Monarchies: Daniel had foretole that it ſhould ſo come to paſſe: at whoſe comming al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Gods of the heathen were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and came to nothing.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2250:84"/> almoſt ouer all the worlde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge whome; Luke writeth that many were religious: who although they wanted the knowledge of Chriſt, yet they ſpread the ſéede of more pure religion, as concerning the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and praying vnto one GOD, and from thence alſo they procéeded afterwarde to thoſe thinges that did concerne the promiſed Sauiour of mankinde. <note place="margin">Acts. 8.</note> Afterwarde followed the Apoſtles, which by the frée prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel ſtoode againſt thoſe their Gods and ſuperſtitions, and the Oracles ceaſed at that time alſo (as the ſtory writers of the heathen doe teſtifie,) whereof the greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of thoſe Gods did depende. And ſo by little and little it came to paſſe, that thoſe Gods, with their ſuperſtitious ſeruing of them, came to nothing: and they being rooted out of mens remembraunces, the true knowledge of GOD, ſhined ouer all nations, which then did inuocate and worſhippe him, not onely at

But when God deſtroyed it without mans hand, it was neuer againe reſtored. Beſides this it is known, that the names of theſe Gods were forgotten amongeſt moſt men: and of ſo many thouſandes, as <hi>Varro</hi> plainly reporteth that were worſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in tyme paſt, ſcarſe a certaine fewe are remembred by name, which the braynſicke, and vngodly Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers did thruſt vppon thoſe that be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt and vnſkilfull.

As I haue deliuered Zedechia the king of Iudah into the hands of Nabucad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar &amp;c.</hi> But Ioſephus recordeth that Nabucadnezar the fifth yeere after Ieruſalem was taken, conducted his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2250:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> armie into the lower Syria, and that after the Moabites and Ammonites were ouercome, he went into Egypt: and that hauing ſlaine the king therof, he appointed an other in his place. And Herodotus writeth that Apries was ſtrangled by Amaſis the captaine, which afterwardes ſucceeded him in the kingdome. But theſe two writers may eaſily be reconciled. For Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadnezar was the Captaine general of the warre, vnto whom Amaſis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoulted, who afterwarde receiued for a rewarde of Nabucadnezar the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Egypt, for his affaires that were faithfully handled in his behalfe. From that time therefore the kings of Egypt were benefactours to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, but after that the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of the Eaſt came to the Perſians, Cambyſis put Pſammenitus from the kingdome, and ſlewe him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, for his attempting of newe matters: And from that time Egypte was without a King about the ſpace of an hundreth and twelue yeeres, vntill the time of Darius Nothus, in
<pb facs="tcp:2250:89"/> the ſixt yeere of whoſe reygne <hi>Amyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus Saires</hi> reuoulted, and became a newe king of Egypt. By the which example we are admoniſhed that the iudgement of God cannot be eſchewed or auoyded by any force of men. And it is principally to be remembred, that God ſaide, <hi>They ſhoulde be ſlaine by his ſwoorde,</hi> whome it is well known to be ſlaine by the Babylonians and Perſians. All they therefore are the ſworde of God, by whoſe miniſterie he doeth execute his iudgement, although they very ſeldomely vnderſtande this myſterie. So in like manner <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> is called the rod of the Anger of the Lord. And it is profitable to note ſuch kind of ſpeeches, that in thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, which befall vs, wée may acknowledge the hande and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD, and ſo become more patient in bearing thoſe thinges that are ſente of him.</p>

And that ſhee might want no kinde of ſinne, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church alſo in moſt cruell wiſe. Theſe therfore are the thinges, that make Cities and kingdoms hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God, and bring deſtructions vpon them: wee méete with like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples euery where.

But becauſe the Prophet did not profit them any whit: now hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the third Sermon, wherein hee inueigheth very manifeſtly agaynſt Ieruſalem, and doeth altogether, as it were by name reproue them, that had the gouernment of thinges. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2250:94"/> he doeth firſt of all rebuke their ſinnes. Secondly he ſheweth the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the ſame. Laſtly becauſe there was ſome godly yet remaining, to the end he might comfort them, he promiſeth them a reſtoring againe, which was fully accompliſhed in Chriſt: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whoſe kingdome, he ſet downe this propheſie, which as it is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident and plaine, ſo is it alſo verie ful of comfort; wherein likewiſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the whole way of our ſaluation. But this ſermon ſetteth foorth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample woorthie of remembraunce, wherein the miniſters of the Church are taught with what frankenes, they ought to deale, with that remedileſſe companie of men, that knowe not too repent, as alſo to haue conſideration of the godly: leaſt they alſo being vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the terrour of their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, ſhould be made without hope of the fruite of their laboures. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place belongeth to the firſt parte. And firſt he dooth generally accuſe the helpeleſſe corruption of the citie. But afterwarde he confirmeth his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:2250:95"/> by reckoning vp their ſinnes, and by and by after, leaſt they ſhould deny them, hee dealeth by name with thoſe, wherein they did moſt offend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He accuſeth the helpleſſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</note> The ſumme of his accuſation is this: <hi>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted to the robbing Citie.</hi> He ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth theſe thinges againſt their vaine bragging and boldeneſſe, wherewith they were puffed vp. For ſéeing the temple and place of outward worſhip, was at Ieruſalem, and the high courte alſo of all the kingdome, they challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the chiefe prayſe of holyneſſe and iuſt dealing vnto them ſelues: but the cauſe of this perſwaſion was for that they thought, that holyneſſe and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſiſted altogether in outward ceremonies, and that the puryfyinges of the lawe did ſuffice to clenſe ſinne. He teacheth therefore that this their perſwaſion was both vaine and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſeing that in the iudgement of God they were polluted &amp; vncleane, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>al viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t robbers &amp; tyrants: yea they inhabited a citie, that might rather be thought a moſt filthy brothel houſe and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2250:95"/> de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of théeues, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing was as it ought to be, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ciuill affayres. The prophet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay in his 1. cap. inueigheth againſt the ſame citie almoſt in like maner; when he calleth the princes Sodomits, &amp; the people to be of Gomorrha, and hauing reiected all their rites (he ſaith) <hi>How is the faythfull citie become a harlot? it was full of iudgement, and iuſtice did abyde in it, but now they are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</hi> We ſhall afterwarde heare the cauſes of ſo fore and grieuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. But now let vs note, that that citie, then the which none in all the world was more famous, is burdened with ſuch heinous crimes: for we may let paſſe the common things that bring worthines and renowne vnto cities, as wealth, antiquitie, and victories &amp;c. Al which it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not, &amp; for the which it is of Pliny called the moſt renouned citie in al the world. Firſt it was praiſe worthy that long ſince, namely 1000. and 300. yeare before Zephaniah pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, Melcheſedek, whom we know
<pb facs="tcp:2250:96"/> to be a figure of Chriſt, was both king and prieſt therof. Againe Dauid made it the kinges ſeate, from whoſe tyme vnto Ioſia, are reckoned ſeuenteene kinges, which in it reigned continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one after an other: beſides this, God vouchſafed to make it the place for his Temple, and myſticall woorſhip, who alſo beautified the ſame with moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall promiſes. For he had ſaide of it in the 132. Pſalm. This is my reſting place for euer: heere will I dwell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue had a loue vnto it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer and beſides all theſe thinges, it was a figure of the Church, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aſcention of Chriſt, began there too bee gathered together, by which name it is chiefly commended in the Pſalmes. But all theſe thinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited not. But that it is ſayde to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily polluted, a robbing citie, yea an harlot, and as Sodome, when it did not agree to the dignitie thereof. No outwarde woorthines therefore can be preiudiciall to the woorde of God, neither yet any glory of titles ought to bleare the eyes of the miniſters of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2250:96"/> woorde, that they ſhould ſpare thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſée woorthie to be ſharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, the raſhe headineſſe of the Romiſh ones is heere alſo reprooued, who becauſe of the olde excellencie of Rome their citie, and becauſe of their predeceſſours, that were ſo notable, by reaſon of their learning, godlineſſe, and crowne of martyrdome, doe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto themſelues a certaine fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, exemption or freenes from all thinges. But what haue they, that may be compared with the woorthines of Ieruſalem, ſéeing it is well known, that thoſe thinges bee lying fables, which they ſo without all ſhame and ſwiniſhly affirme of Peter, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that they ſate as Biſhoppes in Rome. But that we may giue that all thoſe thinges are true, what is it vnto them, which nowe long ſince haue wanderingly forſaken the ſteps of their godly forefathers?</p>

The word of God in deede was preached, and Ioſia had foreſeene that the booke of the law was read openly, and many were the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Prophets, among whom this our Zephaniah and Ieremy were chiefe. But the moſt did diſdaine to heare them, either becauſe they hated the word of God, wherwith they heard their faultes reproued: or els becauſe they thought they ſtoode in no néede of any teaching or inſtruction: and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did heare, yet they obeyed not, but ſuffered themſelues to be caryed away with their moſt filthy delightes. But the prophet not without conſideration beginneth of this. For ſéeing that God in his word hath made his wil known vnto vs, and doeth in the ſame offer Chriſt vnto vs, by whoſe merit we are ſanctified: there is no other way for vs to obtaine ſanctification, but by hearing of his word, and hauing heard it, to imbrace it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a true fayth, which maketh al the vnderſtanding and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our fleſh ſubiect thereto: Chriſt in the 15. of Iohn ſpeaketh of this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For they both retain their natural corruption, and do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer defile them ſelues dayly with new ſinnes, when they want that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which is able to kéepe them in their duties. <note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>He that commeth to God, muſt beleeue that God is, and that hee is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him.</hi> But he vpbraydeth them, becauſe they being not onely content to reuoult, abode ſtil therin, neyther doe thinke at any time how they might méet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him: but it maketh for the ſetting out of their ſinne more at large in that (hee ſaieth) <hi>vnto their God.</hi> For it is as though he ſhould ſay, GOD will be called and be their GOD, becauſe he hath adopted them vnto him ſelfe, and bound them by couenaunt, becauſe hee offereth him ſelfe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his word, and doth allure them by his dayly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges, becauſe all the day long, as it is to be ſéene in the Prophet Iſay,) <note place="margin">Eſay. 56.</note> Hee ſtretcheth forth his handes vnto them, although they will not drawe néere vnto him, but turne away from him,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2250:99"/> as from a moſt cruell enemie: and theſe are the argumentes wherewith Zephaniah proueth that Ieruſalem is a defiled and a polluted Citie. But if a man ſhould ſéeke for theſe thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, it will by and by appeare what may be iudged of vs. For doubtleſſe the word of GOD is preached, and GOD hath reuealed the long hidden knowledge thereof, that I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer ſince the Apoſtles time it hath ſhined more cléerly, or bene more common: yet the moſt eyther heare it not, or els they heare it ſléepily, euen as it were a ſong nothing belonging to them, as GOD by his Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel complaineth of his people the Iewes. <note place="margin">Ezech. 33.</note> Many alſo heare it with lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in waight, that ſo they might get ſome occaſion of euill ſpeaking.

But if they be admoniſhed, or corrected ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharply, thou ſhalt ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtaring mad, which before ſéemed tollerable.
<pb facs="tcp:2250:100"/> God therefore puniſheth with diuers kindes of diſeaſes, with hunger, war; &amp; by his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he thretneth more grieuous plagues: but where is there any, that doeth in them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the hande of God, and that doth confeſſe that theſe are the worthy puniſhmentes of our vnthankefulnes and contempte of his word. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more although God in his ſonne Chriſt do offer ſaluation to them that bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful and vnworthy, and doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe his aſſiſtaunce to them that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him; yet becauſe no man belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, the whole worlde is rent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder into a thouſand ſuperſtitions: and as it commeth firſt to paſſe, that one muſt bee in daunger for the fayth, the moſt doe deny it very diſhoneſtly, that ſo they may get vnto themſelues, the fauour and friendſhip of the world. And forasmuch as God hath no leſſe bound him ſelfe vnto vs, then in times paſt he did vnto the Iewes; nay hath more fully ſhewed in Chriſt thoſe thinges which afore time were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed more darkly, and hath moreouer

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2250:101"/> is the greateſt plague that iudgement hath. For if (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpake for his friend <hi>Plaucius</hi>) that Iudge is euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, that either inueieth, or ſauoureth: what ſhal we ſay of him, that in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hunteth after gaine, then the which nothing hath greater force too mooue the mindes of men. For the ſame <hi>Cicero,</hi> or rather experience being witnes ſaith that abounding wealth, is wont to weaken the religion &amp; trueth of iudgementes. Iethro ſawe this, that would haue Iudges to be haters and enimies to couetouſnes. Exod. 18. In this preſent place therfore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complaineth that wrongfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling did by force come vppon them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and that their court or towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe for pleading cauſes, became a ſpoyling place for robbers, in that that hee compareth the iudges to hungry wolues. But ſeeing they were ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ioſia, that moſt godly and wel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed king, what ſhall we thinke they were vnder Manaſſes and Ammon, who were them ſelues fartheſt of all, from Religion? therefore the
<pb facs="tcp:2250:102"/> order of that common wealth, which hangeth of one alone, is full of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: becauſe it is impoſſible that one ſhould either heare or ſée all thinges that are done among the people. But let them which (truſting of this) doe peruert Iudgement, remember that they haue God a ſéeing witneſſe of al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they doe, which is wont alwaies to be in the midſt of the aſſemblies of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, according as it is written Pſal, 82. <hi>God is in the companie of Gods, hee is Iudge among Gods.</hi>

He calleth them light as well for their learning, as alſo for the looſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and corrupt maners of lyfe. For as for their doctrine, they framed it to the mindes of their hearers, and ſpake pleaſaunt things, as the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Iſay do commaund the prophets. But this is an eſpeciall parte of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2250:102"/> vnder the cloake of the name of God, to ſéeke for priuate commoditie, and to take part with ſin, wherewith it is well knowne that God is angry. But that in the courſe of their life, they were moſt diſſolute, it appeareth by Iſay, <note place="margin">Iſay. 56.</note> who accuſeth the ſeducers of his time, of dronkenneſſe and loue of gluttonie: &amp; ſuch as are wont to be had in reputation among the vngodly. Firſt becauſe of the likenes of their manners, then becauſe they willingly laye open their authorite, neither can they withſtand thoſe whome they ſée to liue very licenciouſly. The Prophet therefore doth not without good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration had, reckon them amonge the number of thoſe, that were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their common deſtruction, which thing I would to God all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters woulde in theſe dayes conſider, and whoſoeuer are alſo delighted with ſuch, whome Chriſt affirmeth to bee like vnſauerie ſalte, &amp;c. <note place="margin">4.

<pb facs="tcp:2250:103"/> he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth al the outward woorſhip and whatſoeuer holy rites were then vſed, the prieſtes did defile them, partly becauſe they did execute or miniſter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> careleſly or prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, partly becauſe they did peruert their vſe and made a cloake for their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe by that, wherewith all men ought to haue beene ſtirred vp to the ſtudie of godlines and conſideration of the promiſed Sauiour. For they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in theſe outwarde thinges the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their ſinnes and deſert of ſaluation, made the temple with al the holy exerciſes therof, a den of theeues, as Ieremie ſpeaketh of them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this could not be done without the corruption of doctrine, he ſaith, that they brake the law, that is, they wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it violently into a contrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which was done then, when (as I ſaid euen now) they placed deſert or merit in thoſe thinges, which did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argue the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our nature, and which ſhould haue led them, as it were a ſchoolemaiſter vntoo Chriſt. This corruption of woorſhippe and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2250:103"/> doctrine reigned alſo in Chriſtes tyme, who openly bringeth certain examples thereof, and teacheth that it muſt bee amended. And I would to God that the ſame were not founde in many Churches in theſe our dayes. For what do thoſe papall fellowes, that to the Pope and his horned Biſhoppes do violently wring thoſe thinges which by the Apoſtles were ſpoken, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church and miniſterie of the woorde, and ſo by the woord of Chriſt do eſtabliſh their outragious tyrannie: when alſo they doe defend their more then vnchaſt ſingle life? The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of meates, Images, the ſacrifice of the maſſe, and other vngodlineſſe of like ſort, by the teſtimonies of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, falſely reported and wickedly wreſted aſide, and doe therewithall liue in ſuch order, that through them the whole miniſterie of the Church is euill ſpoken of. I will not now ſpeak of their ſelling of prieſtes orders, their Simoniacall faire of ſacraments their woorkes of ſupererogation, their
<pb facs="tcp:2250:104"/> indulgences, their fire of purgatorie, their holy Maſſes of <hi>Requiem,</hi> and dyriges for them that be dead, and whatſoeuer other thinges els they haue inuented to the impayring of the merit of Chriſt, and contrary to the doctrine of his trueth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame tymes, and the ſame manners doe requyre the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes, whereof it ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their place. Now let vs note the example of Zephaniah, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one alone, tooke vppon him the cauſe of the trueth againſt the Prophetes and Prieſtes, and doeth accuſe them openly. For that wee may let paſſe thoſe Prophets, whome wee knowe by Ieremy to haue runne, and were not ſent. Yet it is well knowne that the Prieſtes were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by GOD: and by lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſion they did diſcende from Aaron: notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Zephaniah blameth them, and doeth pronounce them worthy of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. From whence then hath the Pope obtayned y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his priuiledge,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2250:104"/> who although hee leade ſoules to hel, will yet bee reproued by no man? But wee reade that Peter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of Paule, and that openly, when hee went not right to the trueth of the Goſpell. <note place="margin">Gala. 2.</note> Or who canne beare them in theſe dayes, which ſay that manyfeſt and open abuſes are not to bee taken away, except it bee by the authoritie of a generall councell, whereof now there can bee no hope, and wherevnto, they that now haue ſome yeares beene accuſed, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſubmitte them ſelues? But will godly Princes and heades of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hazarde the lyfe of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes of ſoules, while theſe decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers gette vnto them ſelues, as it were a whot ſering yron?

But how much more ſhall we be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked therevnto, if it neuer bee out of our minde, that whatſoeuer we eyther ſpeake or doe, we doe it in the ſight of God and his Angelles: let this thought therfore be alwaies in our mind, &amp; as it were pul vs by the eare: vz. that God is preſent with vs, and that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his ſight which ſearcheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart and reines.

But therewithall they haue a diligent regard of the godly, vnto whom they bring in, by the way, the promiſes of ſaluation, leaſt they ſhould with ſuch threatninges caſt them into diſpaire. The Prophet Zephaniah alſo vſeth the ſame order in this ſermon. For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath very ſharpely reprooued the helpleſſe frowardnes of the Iewes, and to them that know not howe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he hath threatned the dredful ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But let vs marke the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets manner of ſpeaking, that (for the Lorde) would rather ſay, the name of the Lord: Namely that he might put a difference betwixt the inuocation of them that beléeue indéed, and them that be but hypocrites, and prophane Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. For al men are wont to boaſt of their calling vpon GOD, when as by common reaſon they are taught that there is a God, that gouerneth all the world, and that we ow vnto him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and inuocation: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not all doe call vppon the name of the Lord.

But they deuiſe Gods vnto them ſelues of their owne braine, which indéede are no Gods. But the godly being taught by the ſcriptures, do call vpon the true God, euen the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore they onely may be counted for the true worſhippers of God. The ſecond dutie is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſerue him with one ſhoulder. This may bee vnderſtoode two wayes. Firſt thus: that they being without hypocriſie, do worſhippe the onely one true God, and haulte not on both ſides; as Elyas ſpake of the Iſraelites. <note place="margin">1.

Thus: to wit, here is noted an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not deuided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſectes and opinions, whereby they might ouerthrowe the fayth of many: but rather ioyne their ſtudies and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

But the Prophet ſpeaketh the ſelfe ſame matter in many words.

And hitherto ſerueth that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning

This agreeth with that ſaying of Iſay, who in like maner foreſhewing of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from Babylon, doeth admoniſh the Prieſtes and Prophets of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſaith, <note place="margin">Eſay. 40.</note>

                     <note place="margin">The ſumme of the doctrine of the Church.</note> But let vs in like manner note the ſumme of that doctrine, which muſt continually bee reteined in the church. The Prophet in theſe two poyntes doth comprehend it: <note place="margin">Luke. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Feare thou not, let not thine handes be letten down.</hi> And they agrée with that parting, which Chriſt himſelfe made, who deuided the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2250:132"/> preaching of his Goſpell, into like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny partes, when hee commaundeth to preach repentaunce, and remiſſion of ſinnes in his name. For herevnto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth which he ſaith, <hi>Feare you not.</hi> For as much as the tremblinges of the conſcience can no other way be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified then by ſure remiſſion of ſinnes, which we obtaine in Chriſt alone. Of that part the Angell beginneth, when to the ſhepheardes that were made afraid with a ſhining from heauen, he ſaith, <note place="margin">Luke. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Feare not, for I bring you tidings of great ioy, &amp;c.</hi> But it muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto repentance, that he ſaith, <hi>And let not thy handes be letten downe.</hi> Namely in performing thoſe thinges, which God requireth of vs. But it is his will that wee ſhould not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſinnes, and liue holyly &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, but alſo that wee ſhould bée conſtant in faith and true religion, and that we ſhould not ſuffer our ſelues to be remoued from it by any meanes. Theſe two thinges muſt alwayes bee coupled together in the doctrine of the Church, leaſt any ſhould diſpaire being
<pb facs="tcp:2250:133"/> ſwallowed vp of the conſcience of their ſinnes, or ſhould vſe the colour of grace and proſperous truſt in the forgiuenes of ſinnes licenciouſly to offend. But this place doeth principally condemne their ſlouth, which when they heare, that the reſtoring of the Church is the worke of God, do forthwith let downe their handes, and do diſorderly let ſlip all occaſion of doing well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He meeteth with daungers and conſcience.</note> But there are two thinges that doe principally hinder theſe matters. That is to ſay, dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers or difficulties, which the world obiecteth without number: And the guiltines of our ſinnes, for the which we perceiue that God is angry with vs: therfor hee maketh anſwere vnto them both. And for the firſt hee ſaieth thus: <hi>The Lorde thy GOD in the middes of thee is ſtrong, he will ſaue thee.</hi> He repeateth the ſumme that he had ſpoken before, and the meaning is this. Thou muſt not now conſider what thou art able to doe, or what the world woulde not that thou ſhouldeſt do: but what God requireth of himſelf. For he is in the middes of thée, and he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2250:133"/> is mightie, and able to do all things: he therefore ſhall ſee you contending with the world and the prince thereof, and wil giue you ſtrength, wherby ye may wraſtle out of all difficulties, or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of matters, and wil in the meane ſeaſon wonderfully preſerue you in the middes of daungers. Hauing regard to the other pointe, he ſaieth, <hi>He ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce ouer the in ioy, &amp;c.</hi> He preacheth the goodneſſe of God, when he ſaieth that he will not caſt vs away for our ſinnes, ſo that rather as a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will reioyce in the familiaritie of his children, <hi>yea he will quiet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in his lore.</hi> That is, hée wil not fill all thinges with franticke and horrible outcries (as men that bee wrathfull, and hauing no ſtay of them ſelues are woont to doe) if he ſee vs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend at any time, but becauſe he loueth vs, he will with ſilence ouerpaſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, and will euen winke at our faultes, as the huſbande that doeth pardon his wife many faultes, if ſo bee hee perceiue hir faythfull in the couenaunt of maryage.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2250:134"/>
                  <p>I knowe that others doe expound it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, that is here ſpoken of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of God. But this meaning, as it diſagréeth not from the purpoſe of the Prophet: ſo it is confirmed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ſcriptures, which in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place by the ſimilitude of ſilence doth expreſſe the goodnes of god, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he pardoneth our ſins.

For ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of God is ſo great towardes vs, our ſlouth ſhalbe deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea and without all excuſe, if wee

He comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the firſt in few wordes, ſaying: <hi>From that time I will gather together thine afflicted, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaith that he wil gather them together, namely that they may returne againe to their own, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the prouinces of the Eaſt. And that after a certain time, that is when the appoynted or foreordained time ſhal come This word moued is, in the Hebrewe, which doeth not ſignifie any time, but that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of purpoſe is appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were vppon agreement vnto ſome thing.

<pb facs="tcp:2250:135"/> which hitherto haue borne the burthen of reproch, that is, baniſhment being filled with reproch &amp; ſhame. But leaſt this promiſe ſhould either be doubtful, or of ſmall waight, he addeth further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, becauſe of the houge power of the Babylonians, and ſaith, <hi>Beholde I will bring all them that haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted thee in that day.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, there is no cauſe why yée ſhould thinke, that the power of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhal diminiſhe any thing at all of my promiſes: for when that appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time ſhall come, they muſt periſh together alſo. Neither ſhall he néede to come from far y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall haue ſtrength y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to beat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe: for behold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen I y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rule ouer al, &amp; at whoſe beck al thinges are either deſtroyed or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wil ſhew my ſelfe an enemie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and wil take vengeance vpon them, <hi>And ſaue her that halteth, &amp; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her that was caſt out. &amp;c.</hi> So he tearmeth the people of Iudea, which becauſe they halted very abhominably in religion, were caſt out, and led away into exile. <hi>Neyther will I onely</hi> (ſaieth

For we know the nature of the fleſh: which either diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the promiſes of God altogether, or being caried hedlong away, doth think that they ſhoulde quickly bee expired. But hee hangeth to as it were a ſeale, that accuſtomed &amp; vſuall clauſe, (ſaith the Lorde) which only is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prouok credence to theſe words: but the hiſtorie beareth recorde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe things were indéede performed vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes: for after theſe 70. yeares were expired, the Monarchy of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians was tranſlated to the <hi>Medes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſians,</hi> &amp; the Captiues had not only libertie to return again, but were alſo let goe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; praiſe. &amp;c.

So did <hi>Plinius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus</hi> declare the maners of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to <hi>Traianus.</hi> And <hi>Cornelius Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> defendeth their report againſt the reprofes of <hi>Nero,</hi> who wold haue had them blamed for burning the Citie. Moreouer God doeth euery day bring againe the captiuities of his Church, and doth after a wonderfull maner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, euen then when al things ſéeme to be in deſperate caſe. Eternall glory in the heauens will follow in time to come, and the crowne of righteouſnes, that neuer fadeth, which the Lord hath

But let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this is the laſt conflict of Antichriſt, and that, that wiſhed for day is not far of, wherein the whole frame of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhal with vs be freed from corruption, but we ſhall poſſeſſe the promiſed kingdome with Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, to whome all thankes giuing, honour, glory and power be giuen for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
